# dicegame
This is a website made with HTML,CSS and JS.

The purpose of this project website is to determine a winner by rolling dice for two player.

Player who gets the larger number of dice will win or if both the players get same number then it will be a draw.

The h1 elemant changes according to the output of the dice rolled.

The image file for the dice is .png and every dice image changes because of the random number generator function added in the javascript.

The funtion then added to a button, So everytime the button gets clicked the dice image shuffles for both players simultaneously.
